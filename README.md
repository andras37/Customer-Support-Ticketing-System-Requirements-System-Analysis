## Customer Support Ticketing System – Requirements & System Analysis

This repository contains a sample **IT Business Analyst / Systems Analyst portfolio project**, created to demonstrate my approach to requirements analysis, business–IT alignment, and system-level thinking.

The project is based on a realistic business scenario and focuses on **analysis and documentation**, not on software development or UI design.

## Project Overview

A mid-sized company currently manages customer support requests through emails and spreadsheets.  
This approach causes lack of transparency, slow response times, and limited reporting capabilities.

The business goal is to introduce a centralized **Customer Support Ticketing System** that:
- standardizes support processes,
- improves response times,
- provides management visibility through reporting,
- can be integrated with existing IT systems in the future.

## Business Objectives

- Reduce average response and resolution time  
- Improve customer satisfaction  
- Increase transparency of support workload  
- Enable SLA tracking and performance reporting  
- Standardize support workflows across teams
